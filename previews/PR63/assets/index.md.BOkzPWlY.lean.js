Understanding patient pathways is an active area of research within observational health studies as they give insight into combinations of drugs patients may be prescribed, duration of treatments, where care is received and overlaps with other treatment regimens patients may be receiving simultaneously. This package provides a generalized methodology to interrogate patient care evolution in OMOP CDM database settings to further motivate the investigation of questions in health economics (such as costs of care), pharmacovigilance, access to care, and observational health research. By analyzing these pathways, researchers can identify patterns, assess adherence to treatment, identify gaps in care, optimize resource allocation, and potentially improve patient outcomes and the quality of healthcare delivery.</p>',8)]))}const u=t(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
